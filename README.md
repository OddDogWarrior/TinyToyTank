# TinyToyTank

This is my very first AR project so far ðŸŽ‰. It is really fun to play around with 3D object seeing through phone ðŸ“±. What I achieved so far is understanding the fundamental setup for AR project, loading 3D object from reality composer, parenting one object to another and animating 3D object based on user's actions. That's it. To be honest ðŸ˜Ÿ, I still have no idea to answer 'What's Augmented Reality?' though. Mmm, it seems I need more learning on it. Definitely ðŸ˜‰! Today is enough. That's all I want to say ðŸ˜œ.
